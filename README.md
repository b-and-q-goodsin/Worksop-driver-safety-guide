# Worksop Driver Safety Pilot

Static page for GitHub Pages. 13 languages: English, French, Romanian, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Turkish.

Live address: https://b-and-q-goodsin.github.io/Worksop-driver-safety-guide/
Reviewer address: the live address with `?review=1` on the end.

The printed QR signs point to the live address. If it ever changes, the signs must be reprinted.

## Source of truth
The English rules and the Goods-In driver instructions follow the gatehouse sheets, which are accepted by management and H&S. Do not change English wording without the same approval.

## Files
- `index.html`: the whole app, one file. All text for all languages is inside it.
- `404.html`: page shown for wrong addresses. The repository already has a `.nojekyll` file, so nothing else is needed.
- `translation-review/`: one sheet per language for the reviewers. Not needed for hosting. Remove after review if you prefer.
- `audio/`, `audio-scripts.csv`, `AUDIO_GUIDE.md`: optional recorded voice. See the guide.
- `voice-test.html`: testing page that lists the voices on a phone. Delete it before the QR goes live.
- `TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md`, `PRELAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`: working notes. Same advice applies.

## Two views of the same page
- **Live address (drivers):** only languages marked reviewed can be tapped. Today that is English only. The others show "Pending translation review".
- **Reviewer address (`?review=1`):** every language can be tapped. A red DRAFT banner shows on each page, and each language button says whether the phone has a voice for it.

## Language release control
Near the top of the script in `index.html` is a line starting `const REVIEWED=`. It lists every language as true or false. Change a language to `true` only after a reviewer has signed it off.

## Publish
1. Upload every file from this folder to the repository root, keeping the `audio` and `translation-review` folders.
2. In Settings > Pages, choose Deploy from a branch, select `main` and `/ (root)`.
3. Open the live address on a phone. Check the welcome page says Pilot 2.0.
4. Keep a downloaded copy of each release.

## Controls
- Do not upload the source PDFs.
- Do not add analytics, credentials, internal links or employee contact details.
- Change the version label on the welcome page (`Pilot 2.0` in `index.html`) with every release so you can tell which version a printed QR points to.

## Voice playback
- Plays a recorded MP3 for a page when one exists in `audio/<language>/` (see `AUDIO_GUIDE.md`).
- Otherwise uses the voices already installed on the driver's phone. The page picks the most natural-sounding voice the phone has for the language, reads one sentence at a time, and pauses between sentences and rules.
- Phone voices vary a lot by language. Lithuanian, Latvian and Bulgarian are the ones most likely to be missing. Test every language on real Android and iPhone devices.
- If a phone has no voice for the chosen language and no recording exists, the page says so in that language and tells the driver to ask Goods-In.
- Printed and colleague-assisted fallbacks stay in place.
